        <h2>Who are they?</h2><h3>
A Cardiac Psychologist is a mental health expert who helps people with heart problems feel better mentally and emotionally.
Heart disease can bring a lot of stress, anxiety, and sadness, and that's where these psychologists step in.
They help patients manage these feelings, cope with the challenges of living with heart disease, and make healthier life choices.</pre>
